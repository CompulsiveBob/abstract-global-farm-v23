# Abstract Global Farm - Contest Deployment Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user needs to deploy the "Abstract Global Farm" game on the Abstract testnet for a contest where people can test it. This is a retro web3 farming game that allows users to:

- Stake $GUGO and $BURR tokens to earn $DIRT
- Buy $DIRT with ETH (0.01 ETH = 50 $DIRT)
- Purchase mystery seed packs with $DIRT
- Plant seeds and grow plants over 7 days
- Interact with plants daily (water, prune, sing)
- Harvest mature plants and mint NFTs
- Collect and trade rare plant NFTs

The game is already configured to use the Abstract testnet and has a complete UI with wallet integration.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State Assessment
- ‚úÖ Project is already configured for Abstract testnet
- ‚úÖ All dependencies are installed and security vulnerabilities fixed
- ‚úÖ Game functionality is complete with wallet integration
- ‚úÖ UI is polished with retro pixel art style
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently running in testing mode (1 minute = 1 day for fast testing)
- ‚ùì Need to determine deployment platform and strategy

### Deployment Requirements
1. **Platform Selection**: Need to choose between Vercel, Netlify, or other hosting platforms
2. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure proper environment variables for production
3. **Testing Mode Adjustment**: May need to adjust testing mode for contest
4. **Domain/URL**: Need a public URL for contest participants
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure fast loading for contest users
