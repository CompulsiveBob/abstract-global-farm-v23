                  In the chaotic world of meme coins, where tokens pump and dump by the hour and the market favors no one, one coin stood out. Not because it promised utility. Not because it had a roadmap. But because it just‚Ä¶ wouldn't stop running.

                  Born from nothing but hype and hope, GUGO became an unstoppable force. He didn't just climb the charts ‚Äî he dominated them. He blew past DOGE, dunked on PEPE, leapt over SHIBA, and finally flipped $BTC, something no meme had ever dreamed of.
